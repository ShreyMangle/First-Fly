      <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        First Fly was built to simplify the confusing engineering
        college admission process for MHT-CET students.

      <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Every year, thousands of students struggle to interpret
        CAP cutoffs and understand where they realistically stand.
        We built First Fly to provide transparent,
        data-driven guidance backed by historical trends.
      </p>

        To democratize transparent and intelligent college admission planning.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem" }}>
        We believe students deserve clarity, not confusion.
        First Fly transforms raw cutoff data into meaningful insights,
        helping students make confident decisions.
